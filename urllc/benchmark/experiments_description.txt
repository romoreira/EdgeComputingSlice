In this experiment we ran BPF_Redirect modifying an IPv6 on Segment List and BPF program redirected packet to proper interface.
We measure the processing time considering the time of ingress and egress collected through Wireshark, which whatched both interfaces at the same time.

Files:
1-11.pcapng -> many icmp requests (containing ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation)
12.pcapng -> 200 icmpv6 forwarding (considering two interfaces on Wireshark) - BPF_Redirect()
13.pcapng -> 200 icmpv6 forwarding (considering two interfaces on Wireshark) - SR_CONF
14.pcapng -> 200 icmpv6 forwarding (considering two interfaces on Wireshark) - BPF_Redirect_Map()
15.pcapng -> 200 icmpv6 forwarding (considering two interfaces on Wireshark) - SR_CONF - End-to-End Ping
